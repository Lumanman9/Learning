# Predictive Analytics for Multi-modal Documents and Time Series Data

Given mutil-modality documents and time series data, try to predit what would happen in the future. This could be predicting whether the an close defined event will happen, or open defined events, and generate reports based one the information.For example: Given the annual reports and stock historial price, predict whether the stock will up or down. Another example: Given the annual reports and audit report to decide whether the company will default. 




## Problem Definition

**Objective:** Develop a predictive analytics system that integrates multi-modal documents (text, tables, images) with time series data to forecast future events and generate comprehensive reports.

**Scope:**
- **Prediction Types:** 
  - **Open-ended event discovery:** The system identifies potential future events or outcomes without predefined classes
  - **Dynamic class generation:** The model determines relevant classification categories based on document analysis
  - **Emergent pattern identification:** Uncovering unexpected relationships and potential future states
  - **Scenario generation:** Creating multiple plausible future narratives with probability estimates

## Key Applications

### Financial Forecasting
- Discovering unforeseen market shifts by analyzing annual reports, news, and price patterns
- Identifying novel risk factors not captured in traditional models
- Generating potential business evolution scenarios beyond simple "default/no default"

### Business Intelligence
- Uncovering emerging customer segments and behaviors not previously categorized
- Identifying unexpected product use cases and market opportunities
- Generating novel competitive differentiation strategies based on document analysis

### Risk Management
- Discovering previously unidentified threat vectors in business operations
- Generating potential crisis scenarios not observed in historical data
- Identifying complex interdependencies between seemingly unrelated risk factors

## Technical Approach

### 1. Data Integration
- Document processing with semantic understanding across modalities
- Unsupervised pattern detection in combined document and time series data
- Topic modeling and entity relationship extraction for event categorization

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- Self-supervised learning to identify potential future states without labeled data
- Generative models to create plausible future scenarios
- Reinforcement learning from feedback to refine scenario generation
- Causal discovery to identify potential trigger events

### 3. Report Generation
- Narrative construction explaining potential future scenarios
- Confidence scoring for generated predictions
- Decision tree mapping of potential outcomes and intervention points
- Visual representation of scenario probability distributions

## Evaluation Framework

- Novelty and usefulness of discovered potential events
- Scenario plausibility assessment
- Prediction diversity metrics
- Expert validation of generated scenarios

This framework enables organizations to move beyond predicting only known outcomes to discovering potential futures they hadn't considered, providing strategic advantage in rapidly changing environments.
